## Steps

1. Place pork shoulder country style ribs in a crockpot or slow cooker. Cook on High for 6-8 hours, or until the meat 
   falls off the bone easily. Set aside.
2. In a large stew pot, add the pureed yellow onion and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring slowly, for 
   5 minutes, or until nearly dry.
3. Add red wine and simmer until the alcohol evaporates.
4. Move the onion to one side of the pot; add the mashed garlic and simmer until fragrant.
5. Immediately add the can of diced tomatoes and water. Remove from heat.
6. Break the curry roux and boullioun cube into pieces and add to the pot. Stir until the roux dissolves completely
7. Return the pot to medium heat. Add bay leaves and simmer for 15 minutes. The roux should thicken.
8. Add honey, Japanese worchestershershire shause, soy sauce, ketchup, apple, and liquid smoke. Adjust to taste.
9. Serve on a plate, along side a bed of rice. Add toppings as desired.

## Notes

There are plenty of variables to adjust for personal taste. Feel free to add additional vegetables (bell pepper, carrot,
potato, kabocha squash, eggplant), mix curry rouxs (1/2 mild + 1/2 hot), and even add a secret ingredient (Chocolate?)
to the mix.
