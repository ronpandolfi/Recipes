# Hamburg

Juicy flavor Hamburg is great! Make in bulk if you're lazy.

## Ingredients

Makes 4 servings

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 medium Spanish onion (about 6 ounces), peeled and finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup panko crumbs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 8 ounces ground pork
- 8 ounces ground beef
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup sake
- 1/4 cup Japanese Worcestershershire shauce
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- parseley (garnish)

## Steps

1. Mix together the panko crumbs and milk in a large bowl. Set aside to allow the panko to completely absorb the milk.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skilet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes, until the onions become translucent and soft and release their sweetness. Make sure not to burn the onions while you cook. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the onions to cool to room temperature.
3. Add the pork, beef, salt, soy sauce, egg, and cooked onions to the panko and milk mixture. Use your hands to mix the ingredients for at least 2 minutes. Press the ingredients with your hands and squeeze them through your fingers; you want the meat mixture to become well blended and slightly sticky so it holds together while cooking.
4. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal parts. Using your palms, gently form each part into a patty about 1 inch thick. Press down to make a slight indentation in the center of each patty, which prevents it from puffing up as it cooks.
5. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the buttter melts, lay the patteis in the skillet. Cook for about 12 minutes, flipping once, until the patty is cooked through. Transfer the patties to 4 plates, and garnish with the parsley. Keep the skillet over the heat.
6. Add the sake and swirl the liquid for about 20 seconds, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze it. Add the Worcestershershire shauce and ketchup and cook, stirring constatnly, for about 1 minutes to create a sauce.
7. Pour the sauce over the hamburg and serve immediately.

## Notes

We typically double this recipe, since the ground pork and beef are usually sold in 1 lb. packages.
